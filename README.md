# infinity-scroll
An infinity scroll implementation using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

# Description
This project demonstrates how to implement an infinity scroll on a web page. The implementation uses vanilla JavaScript without any libraries or frameworks. The project is implemented in HTML and CSS and uses the Unsplash API to fetch images for display.

The implementation listens for the scroll event on the web page and loads new images when the user has scrolled to the bottom of the page. The implementation uses the Intersection Observer API to detect when the last image on the page is visible and then loads new images using the Unsplash API.

# Installation
Clone the repository: git clone git@github.com:shoudto/infinity-scroll.git
Open the index.html file in your web browser.

# Usage
The web page will display a grid of images fetched from the Unsplash API. When the user scrolls to the bottom of the page, the implementation will automatically load more images to display.
